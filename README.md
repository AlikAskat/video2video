Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI Video Extension

Simple plugin to make img2img processing on video files directly. Saving in H264 codec in "img2img-video" folder.

Under development, not that perfect as I wish

Right now need to start from "Inpaint upload" tab in img2img, or add any dummy image to img2img tab input
